As you exhale, bring them in front of you, swinging your right arm under your left and grabbing your shoulders with opposite hands. If your palms can touch, let your right fingers press in your left palm. If they canâ€™t, press the backs of your hands together. Inhaling, lift your elbows a few inches higher. Exhaling, relax your shoulders down away from your ears. Take a few breaths, repeating the elbow lift and shoulder roll. When ready, switch sides.",
